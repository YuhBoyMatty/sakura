## Key Features

* Modern and User-Friendly Interface: Sakura features a sleek and intuitive menu interface that is easy to navigate. It provides a seamless user experience and makes it easy to access all the features.
* Customizable Colors: With Sakura, you can customize the menu colors to your liking. This means you can personalize the interface and make it match your own preferences.
* Powerful LUA Scripting: Sakura is built on top of the powerful LUA scripting language, which allows for complex and dynamic interactions. This means you can create custom scripts that automate tasks, enhance functionality, and improve performance. If you need help with scripting, check out our [documentation](https://sakura-9.gitbook.io/sakura/).
* Bypasses: Sakura includes several bypasses that allow you to bypass various anti-cheat systems. These bypasses are constantly updated to ensure that they work with the latest versions of anti-cheat software.

## How To Use

To run this cheat, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) or downloaded source code and installed [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) on your computer and basic knowledge how to compile it.

## To-do

* Improve Lua functions: We are constantly working to improve the Lua scripting capabilities of Sakura. In addition to fixing bugs, we are working on adding new functions and improving existing ones to make it easier for users to create custom scripts.
* Add Save/Load functions for Lua: We are planning to add Save and Load functions for Lua scripts, which will allow users to save their scripts and settings and load them later.
* Improve UI customization: We are working on adding more options for customizing the user interface of Sakura, including the ability to change font styles and sizes, and the ability to add custom backgrounds and themes.
